# Day 10: The Hacking Minigame 
In this game, the player must hack a computer by guessing a seven-letter word used as the secret 
password. The computer’s memory banks display the possible words, and the player is given hints as to 
how close each guess was. For example, if the secret password is MONITOR but the player guessed 
CONTAIN, they are given the hint that two out of seven letters were correct, because both MONITOR 
and CONTAIN have the letter O and N as their second and third letter.
