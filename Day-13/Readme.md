# Day 13: Hangman 
This classic word game has the player guess the letters to a secret word. For each incorrect letter, another 
part of the hangman is drawn. Try to guess the complete word before the hangman completes. The secret 
words in this version are all animals like RABBIT and PIGEON, but you can replace these with your own 
set of words. The HANGMAN_PICS variable contains ASCII-art strings of each step of the hangmanâ€™s 
noose.
